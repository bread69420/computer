Wordle and Nerdle are games that are having an increasing trend these days. Similar to those two, our game to be designed, Nerdie, is an equation version of Hangman that requires player to guess the equation correctly.

#### Rules

The player will be given a sequence with a specific number (the length may vary, unlike in Nerdle) of spaces like this:

`_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _`
